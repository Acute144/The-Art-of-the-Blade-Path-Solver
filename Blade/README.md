Before using the program read the google doc on how to find the groups

This program will tell you where to go in the mini wave part based on 
you inputting certain information

In order for this program to work you must either download python onto your computer
or run the program through an online python code compiler

There is two variations of the program, Blade_col.py and Blade_group.py
Blade_col.py will generate the required path in the mini wave based off of your inputting the colors of the indicators throughout the level
Blade_group.py will generate the required path in the mini wave based off of your input of the groups themselves
(For Blade_col you dont have to manually convert the colors to groups)
