This is a program to find the correct path to go in the mini wave part of the Geometry Dash Level "The Art of the Blade".

This is needed because each time you restart the level the path you need to take in the 62% mini wave part to pass the wall of spikes at 98% changes, in order to figure out what this path is you need to find the colors that three different objects pulse during the attempt and then convert those colors to group ids before converting the group ids to the correct path that you need to take.

This is a slow process which more importantly can go wrong a lot of the time if a color is either misremembered or unknown.
Due to this I created this program which allows for the user to enter either the color of each of the objects or the group ids directly and recieve the correct path to go in the mini wave part.
The program also allows for the user to enter multiple colors or group ids for each object if they are unsure of the correct one.

Before using the program you need to read the google doc on what to look at during each attempt to figure out the colors/group ids.
